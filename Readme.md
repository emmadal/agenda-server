# GraphQL Server + MongoDB Database

this is a GraphQL Server deployed on heroku for my own test.

## How to get started ? 

1. `git clone https://github.com/emmadal/agenda-server`
2. cd agenda-server
3. npm install or yarn install

## Note
If you are a Database locally, you can change the url in the `dbConnect()` function from `index.js` file
